Monte Carlo localization is an algorithm that allows a robot to estimate its position and direction. It generates random guesses of where it will be next, which are known as particles. The particles include information from the environment of a possible future location. The robot gathers information from its surroundings, then proceeds to eliminate the random guesses if they are inconsistent with the gathered data. It proceeds to generate additional particles until the particles are consistent with its observations.
